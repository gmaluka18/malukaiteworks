									<p>Open-minded. Iâ€™m part of LCC International University, which values diversity. In this global age, it is important to know how to work with people from various cultural backgrounds.

									<p>Writer. I was passionate about writing since 2011, because of that I developed creativity and quick-thinking. These skills I use daily when I need to come up with intuitive ideas. I have experience writing not only fictional works, but also non-fiction such as articles and social media content. </p>
